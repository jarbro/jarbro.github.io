Another wonderful feature Microsoft has put into Windows 10 build 1703 is https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2017/04/06/new-share-experience-windows-10-creators-update/#zJ8fkFwpFXkSIF2Y.97[*Shared Experiences*]. The feature stems from  Project Rome and is very similar to Apple's Handoff Feature.  It's not terribly difficult to disable from an end user perspective, but as an administrator you want a bit more control over your organization's workstations. 


==== Disable in User Mode
In order to disable the Shared Experiences from an end-user perspective.  Simply go to Settings > Shared Experiences and flick the toggle switch to off.

That's all there is to it.
